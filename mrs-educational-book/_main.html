<p>In 2021, the Committee for Code &amp; Data Sharing, a standing committee of the MR Spectroscopy (MRS) Study Group within the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), set out to compile and curate educational materials related to MRS. Our goal was to develop a centralized resource of MRS-related materials that is freely available, annotated, and updated often. While a plethora of MRS resources exist, these can be difficult to navigate for newcomers to the field. This e-book contains a glossary and summaries written with college-level students in mind, and educational materials were provided by the global MRS community. The first edition of this collection was debuted at the 2022 ISMRM Annual Meeting in London, England, and we hope researchers will continue to contribute new educational content and material. We encourage this resource to be shared widely with students, collaborators, and colleagues who are interested in learning more about MRS and welcome any feedback and future contributions.</p>

<p>There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Label the heading: <code># Hello world {#nice-label}</code>.
<ul>
<li>Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, <code># Hello world</code> = <code># Hello world {#hello-world}</code>.</li>
<li>To label an un-numbered heading, use: <code># Hello world {-#nice-label}</code> or <code>{# Hello world .unnumbered}</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using <code>\@ref(nice-label)</code>; for example, please see Chapter @ref(cross).

<p><strong><code>Spectrum/Spectra:</code></strong> An NMR spectrum is the output of performing the Fourier transform on an FID. It is a 1D signal that contains information about the resonance frequencies from the sample being investigated. Each species in the sample will produce a peak at a specific frequency. The amplitude of the peak indicates the amount of the species, e.g., in proton MRS, the height of the peak is relative to the number of protons the metabolite has. For example, brain MRS has a large water peak present at 4.68ppm. Compared to this water peak, the metabolite peaks are significantly smaller because their concentration is so much less than that of water.
<strong><code>Parts per million (PPM):</code></strong> PPM is the unit used to plot spectra in the frequency domain. Because the resonant frequencies are dependent upon the B0 magnetic field strength, it is difficult to compare spectra from 1.5T, 3T, and 7T scanners. Therefore, they are plotted according to the ppm which is agnostic to the magnetic field strength. *Note: conventionally, spectra are plotted such that the ppm decreases from left to right.
<strong><code>Peak:</code></strong> A peak is a part of the spectra indicating the presence and relative amount of a metabolite. The shape of the peak is most accurately described by the Voigt line shape model which is discussed below.
<strong><code>Noise:</code></strong> Noise is present in every measured signal. In general, noise is normally distributed, i.e. comes from a Gaussian distribution, and can be thought of as being overlaid on top of the data. Past certain thresholds, noise will be to obfuscate the underlying data making it unreliable.
<strong><code>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):</code></strong> The signal-to-noise ratio indicates the amount of noise present in the signal and is often used as a data quality metric. In spectroscopy, this is typically calculated by dividing the maximum value of the spectrum by the standard deviation of a portion of the spectrum that contains only noise. SNR is logarithmic and reported in decibels, dB.
<strong><code>Region-of-interest (ROI):</code></strong> The ROI is a region of a spectra or image that is relevant to the given task at hand. When performing phase and frequency shift corrections, the ROI of the spectrum is often surrounding the water peak at 4.68ppm.
<strong><code>Volume-of-interest (VOI):</code></strong> Similar to the ROI, the VOI is the region of interest in an imaging volume. In brain MRSI, this could be a physiological structure or a pathological tumor.
<strong><code>Pixel:</code></strong> A pixel is a single data point in a 2D image. As the density of pixels increases, so does the spatial resolution of the image.<br />
<strong><code>Voxel:</code></strong> A voxel, much like a pixel, is a single data point that represents a volume. MR images are presented as 2D images or stacks of 2D images; however, they actually represent a 3D volume in space. In MRSI, voxels are ideally isometric, i.e. a cube with equal sides, and have a size of 10mm^3. Even though the voxel size can be set arbitrarily, it is constrained by the magnetic field strength with stronger fields allowing for smaller voxels.
<strong><code>Baseline:</code></strong> In spectroscopy, baseline refers to a broad signal offset. The baseline must be accounted for in order to accurately quantify the metabolites in the data. There are many approaches for dealing with baselines. Some techniques use tailored smoothing protocols while others might use Coiflet wavelets, p-slines, or basis lines, whether simulated or acquired. Each approach has pros and cons and these can change with each type of data. It should be pointed out that some spectroscopists include macromolecular baseline and lipid signals in their definition of baseline while other spectroscopists model these two signals separately. There is no consensus regarding this dispute.
<strong><code>Time domain:</code></strong> The time domain is an information domain in which data is expressed as a function of time. Examples of time domain signals include voice recordings, ECGs, FIDs, weather forecasts, and stock market trackings.
<strong><code>Frequency domain:</code></strong> Unlike the time domain, data in the frequency domain represents either a single time point or a fixed length of time. The units of the x-axis change from seconds to hertz. FIDs in the frequency domain are called spectra and they represent the frequencies of the sinusoids that make up the given FID.
<strong><code>Field strength:</code></strong> the strength of the primary magnetic field, B0, that is responsible for homogenizing the molecular spins. As this magnetic field becomes stronger, it is able to homogenize a greater percentage of the atoms inside its field. Normal clinical MRI scanners have a strength of 1.5 tesla (T). Newer scanners have an ultra-high field of 3T. Some research scanners can have 7T or higher but are not used clinically.
<strong><code>Echo Time (TE):</code></strong> the amount of time between the RF excitation pulse and when the signal is recorded. Short echo spectroscopy generally uses about 35ms while long echo is 144ms.
<strong><code>Repetition Time (TR):</code></strong> the amount of time between the first excitation pulse of a sequence until the first excitation pulse of the following sequence. This period of time will include an excitation pulse sequence followed by one or more echoes. It should be sufficiently long so that T1 and T2 relaxation is complete before the next sequence.</p>
<p>filtering and other pre-processing steps (apodization, zero-filling; and what ‘pre-processing’ means)</p>
<p>##Pre-processing steps:
<strong><code>Pre-processing:</code></strong> a series of steps taken to improve the quality of the acquired spectra. Depending on the expected use of the processed spectra, not all pre-processing steps may be appropriate. These steps include coil combination, phase correction, frequency shift correction, zero-filling, apodization, and might include baseline removal.
<strong><code>Zero-filling:</code></strong> adding zeros to the end of the FID in order to increase the spectral resolution after the Fourier Transform.<br />
<strong><code>Apodization:</code></strong> Apodization is a way to smooth some of the noise in order to improve the SNR. This is done by multiplying the FID by a negative exponential function. This is analogous to applying a low-pass filter to the data. This works because noise typically occurs in the higher frequency ranges. Even though this improves the SNR, it has the undesirable effect of line broadening. Line broadening not only widens the metabolite peaks in the frequency domain, it also lowers their peak heights. Therefore, this should not be used in combination with a linear combination model.
<strong><code>Phase correction:</code></strong> All MRI measurements produce complex data. In spectroscopy, the real component of the spectrum needs to be in what’s called “pure absorption” mode in order to produce accurate quantification results. There are two types of phase offsets that need to be corrected: zero-order and first-order.
<strong><code>Zero-order phase correction:</code></strong> Zero-order phase affects the entire spectrum uniformly. The basic objective functions used to correct this offset include maximizing the area under the real component while minimizing the area under the imaginary component. Entropy minimization could also be used.
<strong><code>First-order phase:</code></strong> First-order phase, also known as linear phase, is frequency-dependent. Typically, the water peak at 4.68ppm is used as the reference point for correcting this offset. First-order phase can be apparent when evaluating the shape of the metabolite peaks. The larger the phase offset, the more asymmetrical the peaks become with the side furthest from the reference point developing more and more severe tails. The objective function for this correction also includes a non-negativity constraint.<br />
<strong><code>Frequency shift:</code></strong> Frequency shift is the phenomenon of metabolite peaks being shifted left or right in the frequency domain. This can be caused by things like temperature differences and changes in pH. This can be challenging in in vivo spectroscopy because external references are not commonly used as standards to determine the correction. In proton MRS, the water peak is typically used. However, in water-fat spectra, the triglyceride peaks are used instead because they are more stable. Once the fat peaks have been corrected, then a second correction is used for the water peak. Fitting algorithms often allow for small tolerances, ±20Hz, for each metabolite, which for 3T spectra is about 0.05ppm.</p>
<p><strong><code>Peak shape:</code></strong> Peak shapes are described position (generally ppm), maximum height (indicative of their concentration), and their full-width half-maximum. It should be noted that due to the nature of in vivo MRS, absolute quantification is not possible. Relative concentrations are calculated by quantifying the maximum height or the area under the peak. These values are then compared to a stable reference that is also present in the signal.
<strong><code>Lineshapes:</code></strong> For spectroscopy data, there are three lineshape profiles that describe the spectral peaks: Lorentzian, Gaussian, and Voigt.<br />
<strong><code>Lorentzian lineshapes:</code></strong> These are generally rather narrow lineshapes. This means that their full-width half-maximum is generally small. While being narrow is desirable, they also decay rather quickly through time. The Lorentzian term is defined as exp(+t/T2*).
<strong><code>Gaussian lineshapes:</code></strong> These peaks tend to be broader than Lorentzian peaks, but decay more slowly. This term is defined as exp(-t2/TG2).
Voigt lineshapes: Voigt lineshapes combine the Lorentzian and Gaussian terms to create a more realistic lineshape that is still narrow and maintains a long decay time.</p>
<p><strong><code>Basis set:</code></strong> When simulating or fitting spectra, it is common to use a set of ideally simulated spectra for the given echo time, scanner brand (e.g., GE, Siemens, Philips), and metabolite. A simulated spectrum for an individual metabolite is called a basis line and a collection of these basis lines is known as a basis set.
<strong><code>Residual:</code></strong> When fitting a spectrum, a series of parameters are used to convert a standard basis set into a spectrum that matches the input spectrum. The residual is what is left after the fitted spectrum is subtracted from the input spectrum. The input data is generally noisy while the fit is noise-free, therefore, a good fit should result in a residual that looks like pure Gaussian noise. As the quality of the fit declines, larger and more noticeable artifacts appear in the residual.
accuracy, reproducibility, reliability (reference paper)</p>
<p><strong><code>Full-width half-maximum (FWHM):</code></strong> The width of a spectral peak at half of the peak’s maximum height. This value is commonly used as a measure of the peak’s resolution.
<strong><code>Spectrometer:</code></strong> The spectrometer is responsible for controlling the generation of the excitation pulse and the acquisition of the NMR signal.<br />
<strong><code>Peak fitting:</code></strong> It is the approximation of a dataset that is usually noisy to a given model. This approximation is done through a fitting algorithm. Peak fitting enables the quantification of MRS spectra.
<strong><code>Spectral peak:</code></strong> See Peak.
Peak integration: Peak integration is used to determine the area under the peak. The area provides an estimate for the peak intensity, as well as the relative concentration of the nucleus being studied.
<strong><code>Birdcage coil:</code></strong> A birdcage is a volume coil consisting of “legs”, or rungs, that are connected by end rings. This is the most used volume coil, and it is mostly used to transmit the MR signal since it can produce a very homogenous B1+ field.
Surface coil: This coil is commonly designed as a circular loop, but it can also have other shapes. They are used for receiving the MR signal since they provide improved SNR over a small region. Surface coils are combined to make arrays and increase the field of view.
<strong><code>Peak area/height (intensity/amplitude):</code></strong> See Peak Integration. The area under a peak is obtained through peak integration and it is a measure of its intensity and the relative concentration of the NMR nucleus.
<strong><code>Transmit:</code></strong> The transmit step of the NMR experiment consists of exciting nuclei using a time-varying magnetic field (B1). This field is produced by a transmit coil, usually a volume coil, tuned to the Larmor frequency.
<strong><code>Receive:</code></strong> The receive step of the NMR experiment consists of detecting the voltage induced on the receive coil because of the oscillating magnetic field generated by the spins. This signal goes through a chain of amplification, filtering, and other signal processing steps. The receive and transmit chains are separated through the transmit/receive switch.
<strong><code>Multi-channel:</code></strong> multi-channel systems consist of multiple receivers that are available for every coil in the system. These coils may correspond to coils used for different frequencies or for those in a coil array system.<br />
<strong><code>Water suppression:</code></strong> A challenge with 1H spectroscopy is that the signals coming from different molecules containing hydrogen are usually overwhelmed by the water signal. As a result, there are pulse sequences that can be used to suppress the water signal.
<strong><code>Fourier Transform:</code></strong> The Fourier transform is a technique used to transform data between the time and frequency domains. In NMR, the Fourier transform enables the conversion of the time-varying signal, also known as Free Induction Decay (FID), into spectral peak(s).
<strong><code>Transients:</code></strong> Also known as averages, transients determine the number of times the NMR experiment is repeated.
<strong><code>Shimming:</code></strong> Shimming is the process of correcting the inhomogeneities of the main magnetic field (B0). Shimming can be a passive or an active process. Passive shimming consists of adding ferromagnetic metals in specific locations within the magnet to compensate for the inhomogeneities. Active shimming is accomplished with shim coils that adjust the field in different directions, e.g., x, y, z, and it is user-controlled.
<strong><code>Nuclear spin:</code></strong> Nuclear spin is a property of nuclei that defines its angular momentum.<br />
Spin up/spin down: When placed in a magnetic field, nuclei that exhibit magnetism can have multiple spin states. For a nucleus with ½ spin, such as hydrogen, there are two states, up or down. The spin-up state is in alignment with the main magnetic field. The spin-down state is in the opposite direction of the magnetic field.<br />
Energy splitting: The spin states of nuclei have different energy levels. The difference between energy levels is known as energy (or Zeeman) splitting.</p>
<p><strong><code>Flip angle:</code></strong> is the amount of rotation the magnetization is experiencing during the application of an RF pulse. It is usually expressed in degrees (ο). Often used amounts are the 90o and 180o.<br />
In reality, a flip angle is not uniform throughout an image. It is affected by the type of coil (surface vs volume), the used RF pulse shape (e.g. rectangular, Gaussian, sinc), as well as slice-selection gradients, and B0 field inhomogeneities. These effects become particularly problematic as field strengths are increased.</p>
<p><strong><code>Pulse:</code></strong> there are many types of pulses used in MRS. An ideal pulse is a square pulse.<br />
An adiabatic pulse creates a more uniform flip angle distribution over the wide range of B1 field strength. The pulse utilizes lower power and therefore longer pulse durations are needed in order to obtain the same flip angle. The term adiabatic comes from the fact that the direction of the effective field changes slowly with respect to its strength. Their advantage is that the magnetization can be turned completely independently of the strength of B1 field and thus independent of inhomogeneity of the B1 field.</p>
<p><strong><code>Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB):</code></strong> They express the lower threshold of the error associated with a model fitting. The evaluation tool LCModel is one of the most common tools providing such values with every spectral analysis.</p>
<p><strong><code>T1:</code></strong> The longitudinal relaxation T1 (or spin-lattice relaxation) describes the return of the spin system to the magnetic equilibrium state and involves energy exchange with the environment. T1 can be viewed as the time required for the z-component of the magnetization to reach about 63% (=1-1/e) of its maximum value. For biological tissue, proton relaxation times are typically of the order of a few tenth of a second to several seconds and depend on the magnetic field strength.</p>
<p><strong><code>T2:</code></strong> The transverse relaxation time T2 (or spin-spin relaxation) is the process by which the transverse components of magnetization decay or diphase. It involves the loss of the phase coherence between nucleus precession in the transverse plane. As a results the net magnetization decreases as a function of time. It is the time required for the transverse magnetization to fall to approximately 37% (=1/e) of its initial value.</p>
<p><strong><code>T2*:</code></strong> Additional to the T2 relaxation time there are additional mechanism leading to loss of phase coherence. The spatial variations in the strength of the magnetic field within the body either due to the intrinsic magnet design which does not produce a perfectly uniform magnetic field over the entire object and due to the different magnetic susceptibilities of different tissues (mainly pronounced at air/tissue and bone/tissue boundaries). Together all these mechanisms account for the relaxation time T2*.</p>
<p><strong><code>B0:</code></strong> The main magnetic field of an MR system. It is created by the main superconductor. Usual range for clinical systems are 1.5T to 7T while for preclinical systems values of up to 20T have been reported.</p>
<p><strong><code>B1:</code></strong> The magnetic field B1 is produced by a coil (surface or volume) during the pulse application and it is applied perpendicular to the main magnetic field B0. It spatial distribution is affected by the operational frequency of the MR scanner, the electric properties of the sample and the samples geometry. It can be divided into two fields the B1- which described the sensitivity of the coil in the receive mode and the B1+ which is the filed created by a coil while applying an RF pulse. magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong><code>J-coupling:</code></strong> J-coupling (also called spin-spin coupling) is mediated through the binding electrons connecting the coupled spins. It is an indirect interaction between two nuclear spins that arises from hyperfine interactions between the nuclei and local electrons. The coupling does not depend on the main magnetic field strength but the difference between the two doublet-peaks, when expressed in ppm, does.</p>
<p><strong><code>gyromagnetic ratio:</code></strong> The ratio of the magnetic moment to the angular momentum of a particle is called gyromagnetic ratio (γ). Usually is expressed in MHz/T, for example the gyromagnetic ratio of 1H is 42.58MHz/T.</p>
<p><strong><code>chemical shift:</code></strong> Nuclei of identical atoms in different molecules or at different positions in the same molecule emit slightly distinguishable frequencies after excitation. These frequency differences are called chemical shifts and are measured relative to the frequency of a reference standard. Often the position and number of chemical shifts are diagnostic of the structure of a molecule.</p>
<p>**<code>upfield/downfield:**</code> The terms describe the location of peak in relation to a peak of reference. Upfield means to the right; downfield means to the left.</p>
<p>**<code>isotope:**</code> Different forms of an element that contain equal number of protons but different number of neutrons in their nuclei, so they have different relative atomic mass but not chemical properties. Some are MR detectable (e.g. 13C), some are radioactive (e.g. 11C), while others are neither (e.g. 12C).</p>
<p><strong><code>Point RESolved Spectroscopy (PRESS):</code></strong> It is the main method used for 1H spectroscopy. The sequence consists of 3 slice selective pulses, a 90o followed by two 180o. The PRESS signal at the echo time is a spin echo and it originates only from protons that have experience all 3 pulses. These protons are located in a cube shaped voxel at the intersection of the 3 excited slices. A disadvantage of PRESS is the minimum achievable echo time, so metabolites with short T2 cannot be resolved (e.g. 31P). Another limitation can be tissue heating due to multiple 180o pulses.</p>
<p><strong><code>STimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM):</code></strong> The method uses three slice selective 90o pulses forming a stimulated echo after the total of the echo time (double the time between the first two pulses) and the mixing time (delay between 2nd and 3rd pulse). The signal at the stimulated echo originates only from protons that have experienced all 3 pulses. These protons are located in a cube shaped voxel at the intersection of the 3 excited slices. The method allows shorter echo times compare to PRESS but the signal intensity is only half for the same echo time. Also the usage of 90o pulses allows voxel localization with sharper edges and lower tissue energy deposition.</p>
<p><strong><code>Image-Selected In vivo Spectroscopy (ISIS):</code></strong> It consists of two parts, the preparation and the acquisition. During the preparation, a small 180o pulse together with a gradient inverts the magnetization of a slice orthogonal to the axis of the applied gradient, because only in this slice the resonance condition is fulfilled (slice selective inversion). This is followed by the application of a non selective 90o excitation pulse and signal acquisition. If the experiment is performed twice, once with and once without the selective inversion pulse and then subtract the two signals, we obtain a signal only from the magnetization of the inverted slice. For a 2D or 3D, four or eight experiments respectively have to be performed. The sequence is mainly used for 31P spectroscopy, where metabolites of interest have short T2 values. As signal acquisition starts immediately after the 90o excitation that limits signal losses. Major limitations of ISIS is subtraction errors, due to signal contamination from previous pulses, and motion artifacts, due to multiple excitation requirement.</p>
<p><strong><code>Complex data:</code></strong> FIDs are measured as complex signals. This means that they have both a real and imaginary component. These two components provide complementary information. Phase offsets cycle portions of the signal from the real to the imaginary component. Therefore, raw complex data must have its phase corrected so that it is in a standardized form and ready for post-processing and analysis.</p>
<p><strong><code>Real component:</code></strong> Traditionally, the real component was the only component used for analysis. In “pure absorption” mode, the peak height and peak area correlate with the concentration of the given species. This mode is characterized by peaks reaching their maximum height and their narrowest width.</p>
<p><strong><code>Imaginary component:</code></strong> This is called the imaginary component because it is represented by imaginary numbers. The peaks in this component are wider than in the real spectrum and have significant positive and negative components. After correcting the phase of the spectra, the imaginary component was typically discarded. Modern approaches still focus on the real component, but current techniques and research also include the imaginary component in processing and analysis steps.</p>
<p><strong><code>Magnitude spectrum:</code></strong> The absolute value of a complex number is called its magnitude. It is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary components. While the magnitude spectrum is less informative than the complex spectra, it is helpful because it eliminates the need for imaginary numbers and is unaffected by the phase.</p>
<p><strong><code>Point spread function (PSF):</code></strong> this describes the response of an imaging system that is elicited by a point source. The PSF is also known as the impulse response. Narrow PSFs correspond to higher spatial resolutions and less blurring.</p>
<p><strong><code>Shielding:</code></strong> the electron density surrounding an atom causes local perturbations in the magnetic field that the nucleus experiences. The effect of causing these perturbations and changing the effective magnetic field experienced by the nucleus is called shielding. The result is an upfield or downfield shift of the resonance frequency.</p>
<p><strong><code>Localizer/scout:</code></strong> The localizer is typically a low resolution, fast T1 scan to identify the location and geometry of the object or patient being scanned. This is used to set the saturation bands, to select the shimming region, and to select voxels for acquisition.</p>
<p><strong><code>Fit quality number (FQN):</code></strong> The FQN is a fit metric that should be reported that characterizes the agreement between the fit of a given model and the measured data. This is defined as the ratio of the variance of the fit residual to the variance of the signal’s noise. FQN &gt; 1.0 means that the model got caught in a local minimum or insufficiently models the spectral components. FQN = 1.0 is ideal and indicates that the model agrees with the data, for the amount of noise present. FQN &lt; 1.0 is indicative of overfitting the data. Please note, this does not reflect the accuracy of the model, only the agreement between the model’s output and the data.</p>

<p>Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the <code>index.Rmd</code> YAML. To setup, set the <code>url</code> for your book and the path to your <code>cover-image</code> file. Your book’s <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> are also used.</p>
<p>This <code>gitbook</code> uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.</p>
<p>Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the <code>edit</code> key under the configuration options in the <code>_output.yml</code> file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.</p>
