# Getting started with MRS: A digital collection of community-sourced educational materials

***FOREWORD***

__A digital collection of community-sourced educational materials__

In 2021, the Committee for Code & Data Sharing, a standing committee of the MR Spectroscopy (MRS) Study Group within the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), set out to compile and curate educational materials related to MRS. Our goal was to develop a centralized resource of MRS-related materials that is freely available, annotated, and updated often. While a plethora of MRS resources exist, these can be difficult to navigate for newcomers to the field. This e-book contains a glossary and summaries written with college-level students in mind, and educational materials were provided by the global MRS community. The first edition of this collection was debuted at the 2022 ISMRM Annual Meeting in London, England, and we hope researchers will continue to contribute new educational content and material. We encourage this resource to be shared widely with students, collaborators, and colleagues who are interested in learning more about MRS and welcome any feedback and future contributions.

## Sharing is caring

***Dear MRS researchers***

We, trying to fill the gap between the language used in the scientific literature and the basics introduced in college coursework for people who are started with MRS, encourage Dear MRS researchers to share their materials.  

__Why sharing is important?__

This website is a great example of the living resource of MRS. 
There are a variety of motivations to share your work. 
Others don't have to start from scratch if you share your work; instead, they can build on it.
Believe me, all of your course materials, presentations, and videos are valuable to us.

__How to share?__

People can add their material by simply posting in the [forum](https://forum.mrshub.org/t/call-for-participation-mrs-educational-collection/529) or submitting pull requests on GitHub.
