## Selected books for MRI & NMR

- R.W. Brown, Y.-C.N. Cheng, E.M. Haacke, M.R. Thompson, and R.Venkatesan  `Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design`, New York: J. Wiley & Sons, c1999; 2ndEdition,2014

  (excellent text that balances mathematical strictness and physics concepts with intuitionaland technical explanations!!! specific topics, such as fast spin echo, are treated toa lesser extent than desirable; only a few pages about MR spectroscopy)

- M.A. Bernstein, K.F. Kingand X.J.Zhou `Handbook of MRI Pulse Sequences`,Academic Press,2004

  (outstanding coverage of MR imaging pulse sequences and their various elements, such as radiofrequency(RF)pulses and gradients)

- D.W. McRobbie, E.A. Moore, M.J. Graves and M.R. Prince `MRI From Proton to Picture`, Cambridge University Press, 2ndEdition, 2006 

  (comprehensive introduction to the basics of MR practice and theory; very comprehendible and with superb illustrations;one chapter about MR spectroscopy)

- M.T. Vlaardingerbroek and J.A. de Boer  `Magnetic resonance imaging: theory and practice`, New York: Springer, 1999

  (very good book, though not thought for someone, who makes his/her first acquaintance with MRI (as is also stated in its preface; some common nomenclature with Haacke's book))

- R.H. Hashemi `MRI: The Basics`, Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins, c1997

  very introductory text that summarizes most important concepts of MRI; a suitable tool to obtain a first overview of MRI principles, but does not provide in-depth insight)

- V. L. Kuperman `Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Applications`,San Diego : Academic, c2000 (intended as a text/reference for students, researchers, and professors interested in physical and biomedical applications of MRI)

- P. Mansfield and P.G. Morris `NMR Imaging in Biomedicine`,New York: Academic Press, 1982 

  (classic textbook with elegant treatment of NMR techniques, though too involved for a beginner.

- A. Abragam `The Principles of Nuclear Magnetism`, Oxford, 1961 

  (standard text for quantum mechanical treatment of nuclear magnetism; requires good knowledge of quantum mechanics)
