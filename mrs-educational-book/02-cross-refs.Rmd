# Getting started with MRS

## Selected Books for MRS, MRI & NMR

- R.A. de Graaf `In Vivo NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Techniques`,John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,ThirdEdition, 2018(comprehensive and comprehendible overview of in vivo MR spectroscopy techniques; very extensive treatment of radiofrequency (RF) pulses including adiabatic RF pulses; probably thereference as a textbookfor MRS)
- P.B. Barker, A. Bizzi, N. De Stefano, R.Gullapalli, and D.D.M. Lin `Clinical MR Spectroscopy:Techniques and Applications`,Cambridge University Press,2010(describes underlying physical principles of MRS and provides a perceptive review of clinical MRS applications)
- R.W. Brown, Y.-C.N. Cheng, E.M. Haacke, M.R. Thompson, and R.Venkatesan `Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design`, New York: J. Wiley & Sons, c1999; 2ndEdition,2014 (excellent text that balances mathematical strictness and physics concepts with intuitional and technical explanations!!!;specific topics, such as fast spin echo, are treated toa lesser extent than desirable; only a few pages about MR spectroscopy)
- D.W. McRobbie, E.A. Moore, M.J. Graves and M.R. Prince`MRI From Proton to Picture`,Cambridge University Press, 2ndEdition, 2006 (comprehensive introduction to the basics of MR practice and theory; very comprehendible and with superb illustrations; one chapter about MR spectroscopy)
- P. Mansfield and P.G. Morris `NMR Imaging in Biomedicine`,New York: Academic Press, 1982(classic textbook with elegant treatment of NMR techniques, though too involved for a beginner)
- A. Abragam `The Principles of Nuclear Magnetism`, Oxford, 1961(standard text for quantum mechanical treatment of nuclear magnetism; requires good knowledge of quantum mechanics)Selected papers for MRS & NMR(to be completed):
- One of the first papers about the basic concepts of NMR:[1]
- The fundamental concept of an echo is introduced in:[2][1]F. Bloch, “Nuclear induction,” Physical Review, vol. 70, pp. 460-74, 1946.[2]E. L. Hahn, “Spin Echoes,” Physical Review, vol. 80, pp. 580, 1950
